We are a Cybersecurity lab in <a href="https://www.wichita.edu/academics/engineering/SoC/index.php" target="blank">the School of Computing at Wichita State University</a>. We study the mechanisms of systems, in which, physical and software components are deeply intertwined, and address a wide spectrum of security problems in the cyber-physical systems space. 

We are looking for highly energetic students with passion towards cybersecurity!
